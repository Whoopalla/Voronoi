# Simple Voronoi diagram generator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram

Program generates voronoi diagrams in [ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) (p6) format. Which is good for pixel editing, but bad for storing images.
There are programs ([ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), for example) and online converters that will easily convert from ppm to png or jpeg or whatever.
